# Personal Website

![Node workflow](https://github.com/ferrum56/personal-site/actions/workflows/node-ci.yml/badge.svg)

The repository for my personal website. A simple and modern TypeScript Vue-based website.

## Features

TODO

## Environment

The project is run on *Node 20*. As far as I know, it should work on Node 18 as well. Automated CI does additional checks on Node 22 with ubuntu.

## About Fonts and Icons

The website uses multiple fonts. *Novecento Sans Wide* is a geometric, all-cap font used as titles and headings.

The icon set used is the free version of *Font Awesome 6* with solid, regular, and brand icons. SVG icons are chosen to enable tree-shaking and reduce bundle size.
