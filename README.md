# Personal Website

![Node workflow](https://github.com/ferrum56/personal-site/actions/workflows/node-ci.yml/badge.svg)

The repository for my personal website. A simple and modern TypeScript Vue-based website.

## Features

TODO

## Setup

1. Node.js

    Use *Node 20* or above. (Node 18 should work but no guarantee)
2. Package Manager

    Use *Yarn 4* with `corepack`. If not using `corepack`, delete the `packageManager` field in `package.json`.
    ```bash
    corepack enable
    yarn set version stable
    ```
3. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
4. Run the development server

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
5. Testing

    Use *Vitest 3* (current beta) to support Vite 6.
    ```bash
    yarn test
    yarn coverage # With istanbul
    ```

## About Fonts and Icons

The website uses multiple fonts. *Novecento Sans Wide* is a geometric, all-cap font used as titles and headings. *Titillium Web* is a widely used sans-serif font for body text. *Bender* is an industrial-style font used for numbers.

The icon set used is the free version of *Font Awesome 6* with solid, regular, and brand icons. SVG icons are chosen to enable tree-shaking and reduce bundle size.
